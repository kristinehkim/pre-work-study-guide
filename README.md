Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation was to learn the basics of coding.
- I did this because I would like a smooth transition into the bootcamp program.  I know that I am going to learn a lot and at times, it may be overwhelming but having this background knowlege will probide for a smooth transition.
- This will help me in the future.  Since I took notes, I will be able to go back to them during the course.
